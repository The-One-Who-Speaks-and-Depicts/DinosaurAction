Choose your master stats. You have 35 points to delegate into the following parameters, with minimum of 0 and maximum of 9: sprinter, stayer, intelligence, progressivity, perception, luck. To go to choosing stats press 1, to exit game press 2. Stat info is depicted while you are choosing.
Strength gives you ability to enact more powerful physical attacks, as well as deal more effectively with breaking little trees and moving stones. It also gives you much bigger speed on start. But smaller animals can easily escape you.
Speed makes you run faster on the short distances, and increases overall limit of speed. It also lightens your body, so that you can escape some natural traps. However, you may not be so great in fights with enemies of equal size.
Agility increases your stamina, so you can run longer and for bigger distances. Also, if you pick this stat, your skeleton is going to be a lot more durable, and you can survive some vicious battles. However, your body is going to be heavier, and create problems in some pits near swamps.
Perception makes all of your senses better. You see, taste, feel vibrations, and hear on a longer distance, your taste helps you to discover poison. Despite that, your skin is going to be much more sensible to attacks of other predators.
Luck helps you in escaping bigger opponents, traps and poisoned food, as well as finding some good prey and communicating with other animals of your kind. In spite of that, nobody guarantees that in the most crucial moment you do not lose it.
Appearance is a main key to effective communication and cooperation with your relatives, and is significantly important in mating rituals. But it is going to completely destroy your hiding abilities and your camouflage will be nothing but a joke.
Intelligence helps you to estimate your chances of doing anything better, including seeing ways of escaping a trap or key to the heart of your mating partner. No intelligence, though, saves you, if you are in toe-to-toe with a giant version of yourself.
