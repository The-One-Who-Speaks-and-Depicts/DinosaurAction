Now you have to choose main perks. Main perks are basic abilities, granted to your character, that are going to define your gameplay: how you stand, move, hunt, fight, help others, and find a partner. There are 6 categories of them: skeleton, appearance, adaptation, fortune, orientation, and force. Each one has 3 possible options, from which you may choose, and which are named in honour of dinosaur species that made the greatest advantage out of them. Triassic ones tend to be more fast, light, adaptive, individualistic, and indistinguishable from the environment. Cretaceous ones are usually a bit heavier, much stronger, pack-oriented, less adaptive, more conservative, and intelligent. Jurassic species are the heaviest ones, and usually are the worst sign for their enemies, but otherwise try to find something in a middle. Also, each main perk gives you an access to 3 additional perks of level 1, 2 additional perks of level 2, and 1 of level 3. Combinations of the latter ones, as well as your choices throughout the game, will define evolution paths your successors will be able to take, but the final decision is going to be yours. Choose your perks carefully, as you are not going to be able to change them, excluding for time when you choose your gender, and time when you will pass focus of evolution eyes to your younglings.
