The first option to choose is adaptation.

Adaptation in Triassic style is a domain of Eoraptor. 
Eoraptors were not exactly intelligent, so they lack more heuristic approaches to hunt, to fight, to help friends and enchant partners. 
However, their breed usually increases their traits, becomes more effective and accustomed to the world around, and Eoraptors' bodies develop some very unusual traits, although these traits can do bad for them.

The most bright way to adapt in Jurassic belongs to Eustreptospondylus. 
Eustreptospondyli are more intelligent than Eoraptors, however, for them the insufficiency of strategical behaviour is still significantly seen.
Still, they are highly adaptive, despite being slower in that way than Eoraptors, They do not develop some great aromorphoses, but some catastrophic failures are also stepping aside from the wave of their evolution.

Cretaceous brought about Troodons.
Troodons remained being classical raptors in their common plan of body constitution, and hardly ever (excluding Arctic population), developed principally new traits, despite one.
This one is brain. High intelligence allows Troodons to use everything around them for their benefit, and almost transform the environment into something new, not existing before.
